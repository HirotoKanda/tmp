\section{Hamiltonian Formalism}
Hamiltonian formalism is another way to obtain the equation of motion.
Sometimes, it is more convinient to have a coupled 1st order PDEs, rather than a 2nd order PDE, which is the case in Hamiltonian formalism and Lagrangian formalism respectively.
Honestly, derivation of Hamiltonian formalism is motivated by not a clever foresight, but more by the clairvoyance from the people who already developed it.
