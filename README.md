### Review For Particle Physics

Most of code is taken from "Charlie's Math Template": https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles/tree/main/latex_template and adapted to my needs.
This document uses LuaLaTeX, so if you want to compile this source, you need to use `lualatex` instead of `pdflatex`.
Also, some of the fonts are not super common, so you may need to install them on your system.

Much thanks to him (his YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@SeniorMarsTries).

Github Action is used to copy this directory from my original repository to this one.
